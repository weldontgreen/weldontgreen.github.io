## What is a drill?

A drill is an instruction or training meant to improve a skill. There are two main types of drills for League of Legends

**Repetitive Drill**

The skill is easy to replicate quickly in-game or in sandbox mode
It is easy to see success or failure (e.g. flashing over a wall, last hitting a minion)
Simple repetition will most likely increase one’s ability to do it under pressure

**Focus-based Drill**

The skill is harder to replicate quickly in-game or in sandbox mode
It can be harder to see success or failure, but not necessarily (e.g. roaming to bot, invading jungle)
Improving the skill requires a plan, focus on execution, and analysis afterwards

Due to the nature of drills in League of Legends, they take careful thought to construct. In traditional sport drills are forged over many iterations and experiments with feedback from players, coaches, and experts. The most well-constructed drills in any sport often go onwards to become canon and used by major figures and coaches in the sport. Therefore, it is recommended that as you construct drills you build a small “library” of your own drills and work on constantly improving them over time with feedback from players and self-study.

### THE DRILL
When you create a drill, you should include specific instructions that include the skills to use, the game phase, and the soft-skills to focus on. Keep in mind that most drills are extreme in nature, meaning that you will often take a handicap in order to focus exclusively on one thing.

*Example:*
Syndra. From 0 until 11 minutes, every time your opponent walks forward to last-hit a minion you must trade with them with auto-attack or Dark Sphere.

### MEASUREMENT
It is also important to have an end goal. Because good drills will take 100% of your focus and drop your overall performance, having an end goal lets them apply that learning to climbing.

Example:
Continue this drill until you are able to kill/force your lane opponent to base early in 2 consecutive games.

### INSTRUCTIONS
You should also include an explanation along with your instructions that explains why the drill will work, and what skills it will train. This will encourage them to focus on the drill even though it messes up their performance in other aspects of the game.

Example:
These are the skills trained by this drill. (1) You will learn to notice your opponents patterns and intention around CSing. (2) You will learn to CS + harass at the same time using 1 spell or a combination spell + auto-attack. (3) You will learn the timing windows of when you can harass specific champions with Syndra based on their spell cooldowns.

## REPORT CARD

Use this report card to grade your drill

| GRADE | SKILL | MEASURE | TARGET | GOAL |
| 1 | There is no clear explanation of which skills it increases in-game, or the drill is overly complex and not focused. | There is no way for the player to observe the skill increasing or decreasing. | The drill is not suited to the level of the player. They cannot practice it or it doesn’t improve their rank. | There is no end-goal to reach for. The drill does not have a satisfying ending that represents growth. |
| 2 | One clear champion skill and one clear soft-skill is included in a relatively simple drill. | The player can generally see or feel the champion skill or soft-skill increasing. | The drill is suited to the level of the player, and they can practice it most of the time. | The drill has a satisfying end goal that happens within a week. |
| 3 | One clear champion skill and multiple soft-skills are layered into a very simple drill. | The drill results can be easily and objectively measured. | The drill is perfectly suited to the player and i+1. It directly improves the player’s rank. | Every user of the drill experiences skill improvement at the same end-goals. |

## DRILL DATABANK

[SUBMIT A DRILL]

*Lissandra*
Play 3 games of Lissandra. Do a teleport gank at exactly 7 minutes, 13 minutes, and 19 minutes.

This goal’s report card is [SKILL (So-so) MEASURABLE (Yes) TARGET (So-so) END-GOAL (Yes)]

Here are the skills trained by this drill:
(1) The Lissandra ganking-combo will be practiced, as well as holding your ultimate prior to your ganks so that you can use it during the gank
(2) Communication with the team and begging for wards in certain locations so that your gank will be effective.
(3) Game-clock awareness!

*Graves*
Play 3 games as Graves. Only cast Buckshot and Smoke Screen as a combination, and you must hit 2+ enemies with each combo.

This goal’s report card is [SKILL (Yes) MEASURABLE (Yes) TARGET (Yes) END-GOAL (Yes)]. To read about how to tweak this goal, visit mindgames.gg/leaguegoals

Here are the skills trained by this drill:
(1) Seeing patterns of movement in the bottom lane and being able to take advantage of the mistakes your enemies make by moving too close to each other.
(2) Eventually you will be tired of waiting for them to overlap, and you will start figuring out what mind-games you can play to get them to overlap each other accidentally (i.e. pressure them to turret, fighting a lot, drawing them back and forth across lane, dropping a ward for them to hit, etc.)
(3) You’ll get really good at throwing out the combo in conjunction and hitting the skill-shot W as an AoE

*Annie*
Play 1 day of Annie games. Before 10 minutes game-clock, flash-ult once to set up a successful gank. Between 10 - 30 minutes hold the ult in skirmishes 3v3+ until you can cast it to stun 3+ people.

This goal’s report card is [SKILL (Yes) MEASURABLE (Yes) TARGET (Yes) END-GOAL (Yes)]. To read about how to tweak this goal, visit mindgames.gg/leaguegoals

Annie has the potential to make game-ending plays. Regardless of how far behind your team is, Tibbers can take advantage of a single moment of error by the enemy team. Training this group-aoe power means learning to discern and focus on the enemy team’s formation.

Here are the skills trained by this drill:
(1) Seeing patterns in a group of enemies moving - It’s not something we are born with, being able to widen our perspective and try to take in the bigger picture. It’s more common to focus on one, particular thing, especially in a competition. So here we train to widen our focus and watch multiple enemies lines of movements until they converge.
(2) Patience! - Normally we want to use our ult at the first possible opportunity. But Orianna and Annie benefit greatly from holding the ult until the best possible opportunity. Forcing us to unnaturally hold our ult until a specific rule is triggered is a good training exercise.

*Zed*
Play 3 Zed games. From 10-30 minutes game-clock, return to your ult-shadow every cast.

This goal’s report card is [SKILL (Yes) MEASURABLE (Yes) TARGET (Yes) END-GOAL (Yes)]. To read about how to tweak this goal, visit mindgames.gg/leaguegoals

Most of the top play we see with Zed involve using his shadow’s to the fullest extent. A standard-level Zed player will often cast the ultimate based on its main use, which is to deal extra damage to a target. The consideration of returning to the ult-shadow is a decision left until skirmish is engaged. However, you now know beforehand that you must return to the ult-shadow, and can plan out using your ult utility to the fullest.

Here are the skills trained by this drill:
(1) Instinctual timing of ult shadow. It’s better to have a feeling for shadow timing than tracking it visually.
(2) Different ways to use the ultimate shadow. You must return, therefore you only have several seconds to deal damage. However, there are many ways to use the ultimate shadow in a skirmish and still return to dealing damage. Many times on Zed-highlight plays a pro player will return to the ultimate shadow to dodge a skill, but then W or Flash forwards to re-engage. This goal forces you to purposely practice such scenarios.
(3) Dodging skills with your blink. Since you will have to return anyway, you find yourself discovering optimal times to return. Considering which abilities to dodge before you ultimate is a way to take this goal to the next level.
