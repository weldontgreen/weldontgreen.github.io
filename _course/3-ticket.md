## Queue

The ticket system has 2 queues. `LOL` holds open tickets, and `LOLReviews` holds completed tickets waiting for review. The process is as follows

1. Navigate to the `LOL` queue
2. Lock a ticket
3. Create your video
4. Move ticket to `LOLReview` queue

## Locking a ticket

Click on the `Tickets` top menu. You will find the `LOL` queue and `My Queues (1)` *(NOTE: You can add to My Queues on the <i class="fa fa-gear"></i> Settings page.)*

* Only lock 1 ticket at a time
* A ticket will automatically unlock after 2 hours
* Lock a ticket to generate the `MatchDetails` link

**Option A)** Lock a ticket from the queue view by clicking `Lock`
