## Access

Access the ticket system here: [http://academy.shadow.gg/otrs/index.pl](http://academy.shadow.gg/otrs/index.pl)

If you are having problems with your login then email me: Weldon (dot) Green (at) dojomadness (dot) com

![login form](/assets/images/otrs-login.png "login form")

Your `username` is "first 2 letters of your first name" + "first 4 letters of your last name"

> e.g. My name is Weldon Green and my username is wegree

If you do not have 2 or more letters in your first name, or 4 or more letters in your last name, then the `username` is shortened.

> e.g. My name is William Xi and my username is wixi

## Settings

When you are logged in you have two administration screens. Your `Dashboard` and your `Settings` pages.

**Recommended settings**

I recommend enabling the following settings on your `Dashboard`

* Running process tickets
* Out of office
* Logged-in users

![dashboard](/assets/images/otrs-dashboard.png "dashboard")

Next, navigate to your `Settings` page by clicking the <i class="fa fa-gear"></i> gear icon in the corner. I recommend the following

* Change your password
* Set Overview Refresh Time to 2 minutes
* Add "LOL" to your "My Queues" preferred queues
* Modify which notifications you want to receive via email
