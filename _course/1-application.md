## What is Shadow Academy?

Shadow Academy is a division of [Dojo Madness](https://dojomadness.com/). DOJO Madness harnesses the power of big data to build tools and services that help players and fans to understand and master their favorite esports games.

DOJOâ€™s first line of products, the SUMO apps, are virtual coaching apps for League of Legends and Overwatch. [LOLSUMO](http://lolsumo.com) and [OVERSUMO](http://oversumo.com) provide personalized guides and actionable insights based on individualized game data for over one million monthly active users.

DOJO's professional analytics products, the SHADOW apps, are used by broadcasters and professional esport teams to gain insights into the game, their opponents, and their own play. [Shadow.gg](http://shadow.gg) provides services for Counter-strike:GO, League of Legends, and DOTA 2.
