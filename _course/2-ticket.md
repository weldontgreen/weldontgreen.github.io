## Access

Access the ticket system here: [http://academy.shadow.gg/otrs/index.pl](http://academy.shadow.gg/otrs/index.pl)

![login form](/assets/images/otrs-login.png "login form")

Your `username` is "first 2 letters of your first name" + "first 4 letters of your last name"

> e.g. My name is Weldon Green and my username is wegree

If you do not have 2 or more letters in your first name, or 4 or more letters in your last name, then the `username` is shortened.

> e.g. My name is William Xi and my username is wixi

## Setting up

When you are logged in you have two administration screens. Your dashboard and your settings panel.

**Recommended settings**

I recommend enabling the following settings

* Running process tickets
* Out of office
* Logged-in users

![dashboard](/assets/images/otrs-dashboard.png "dashboard")
